# Art hosting e-commerce site
## See at: https://art-hosting-site.onrender.com
#### Note that the site might take up to 50s to load if Render, the hosting provider, has shut down the servers.
This web app is a hobby project where I made a combined portfolio and eCommerce site.
Special flavour is given by the strong thematic elements pulled from the art itself.

### Notable tools used: 
- React
- NodeJs
- Cypress
- TanStack

Design, code and art by me.
